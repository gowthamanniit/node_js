Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion. 

In Node.js, there are four types of streams

Readable − Stream which is used for read operation.

Writable − Stream which is used for write operation.

Duplex − Stream which can be used for both read and write operation.

Transform − A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input.

Each type of Stream is an EventEmitter instance and throws several events at different instance of times. 
For example, some of the commonly used events are −

data − This event is fired when there is data is available to read.

end − This event is fired when there is no more data to read.

error − This event is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data.

finish − This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system.

reading from a stream
======================
var fs = require("fs");
var data = '';

// Create a readable stream
var readerStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');

// Set the encoding to be utf8. 
readerStream.setEncoding('UTF8');

// Handle stream events --> data, end, and error
readerStream.on('data', function(chunk) {
   data += chunk;
});

readerStream.on('end',function() {
   console.log(data);
});

readerStream.on('error', function(err) {
   console.log(err.stack);
});

console.log("Program Ended");

writing to a stream
=====================
var fs = require("fs");
var data = 'Simply Easy Learning';

// Create a writable stream
var writerStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

// Write the data to stream with encoding to be utf8
writerStream.write(data,'UTF8');

// Mark the end of file
writerStream.end();

// Handle stream events --> finish, and error
writerStream.on('finish', function() {
   console.log("Write completed.");
});

writerStream.on('error', function(err) {
   console.log(err.stack);
});

console.log("Program Ended");

pipe the stream(both read and write)
===============
var fs = require("fs");

// Create a readable stream
var readerStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');

// Create a writable stream
var writerStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

// Pipe the read and write operations
// read input.txt and write data to output.txt
readerStream.pipe(writerStream);

console.log("Program Ended");

chaining
=========
compress, decompress
